A0MES8,drought_resistance,Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress),"FUNCTION: Transcription regulator that probably binds to the GCC-box pathogenesis-related promoter element. Binds also to the S-box (5'-CACTTCCA-3') photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes-related (PhANGs-related) promoter element, and thus acts as a transcription inhibitor. Involved in the regulation of gene expression by stress factors and by components of stress signal transduction pathways. May have a function in the deetiolation process. Confers sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA), and regulates the ABA signaling pathway during seed germination, upon nitrate-mediated lateral root inhibition, in hexokinase-dependent sugar responses (including feed-back regulation of photosynthesis and mobilization of storage lipid during germination), and in response to osmotic stress mediated by NaCl, KCl or mannitol. Plays a role in sucrose sensing or signaling, especially at low fluence far red light. Also involved in plant response to glucose treatment, especially at low concentration and in young seedlings. Required for the trehalose-mediated root inhibition and starch accumulation in cotyledons, probably by inhibiting starch breakdown. However, seems to not be involved in sugar-mediated senescence. Required for the ABA-dependent beta-amino-butyric acid (BABA) signaling pathway. BABA primes ABA synthesis and promotes resistance to drought and salt, and leads to a prime callose accumulation that confers resistance against necrotrophic pathogens such as A.brassicicola and P.cucumerina. Seems to be involved in resistance to S.sclerotiorum probably by regulating the ABA-mediated stomatal closure apparently by antagonistic interaction with oxalate.

Involved in oxidative stress-mediated signaling cascade (such as ozone). Involved in the innate immune MAP kinase signaling cascade (MEKK1, MKK4/MKK5 and MPK3/MPK6) downstream of bacterial flagellin receptor FLS2. May be involved in hypersensitive response (HR)-mediated signaling cascade by modulating LIP5 phosphorylation and subsequent multivesicular bodies (MVBs) trafficking. May phosphorylate regulators of WRKY transcription factors. Phosphorylates 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthases (ACS2 and ACS6) and may be involved in the regulation of bacterial elicitor flagellin-induced ethylene production. Regulates locally gene-mediated and basal resistance response to certain pathogens. May be involved in the cold and salinity stress-mediated MAP kinase signaling cascade (MEKK1, MKK1/MKK2 and MPK4/MPK6). MKK1-MPK6 module mediates abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent CAT1 expression with H(2)O(2) production and response to drought and salt stress. MKK1-MPK6 module is also involved in sugar signaling during the process of seed germination. MKK3-MPK6 module plays an important role in the jasmonate signal transduction pathway through the negative regulation of MYC2/JIN1 expression. MKK9-MPK3/MPK6 module phosphorylates and activates EIN3, leading to the promotion of EIN3-mediated transcription in ethylene signaling. MPK3/MPK6 cascade regulates camalexin synthesis through transcriptional regulation of the biosynthetic genes after pathogen infection. MKK9-MPK6 module positively regulates leaf senescence. YDA-MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 module regulates stomatal cell fate before the guard mother cell (GMC) is specified. When activated, reinforces the feedback loop by phosphorylating BASL, and inhibits stomatal fate by phosphorylating SPCH (PubMed:25843888).

Q39026,disease_resistance,Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress),"FUNCTION: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) which regulates abscisic acid (ABA) responses in a MAPKKK20-MKK5-MPK6 cascade involved in root growth (e.g. root cell division and elongation) and stomatal response (PubMed:27913741). Involved in oxidative stress-mediated signaling cascade (such as ozone). Involved in the innate immune MAP kinase signaling cascade (MEKK1, MKK4/MKK5 and MPK3/MPK6) downstream of bacterial flagellin receptor FLS2. May be involved in hypersensitive response (HR)-mediated signaling cascade by modulating LIP5 phosphorylation and subsequent multivesicular bodies (MVBs) trafficking. May phosphorylate regulators of WRKY transcription factors. Phosphorylates 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthases (ACS2 and ACS6) and may be involved in the regulation of bacterial elicitor flagellin-induced ethylene production. Regulates locally gene-mediated and basal resistance response to certain pathogens. May be involved in the cold and salinity stress-mediated MAP kinase signaling cascade (MEKK1, MKK1/MKK2 and MPK4/MPK6). MKK1-MPK6 module mediates abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent CAT1 expression with H(2)O(2) production and response to drought and salt stress. MKK1-MPK6 module is also involved in sugar signaling during the process of seed germination. MKK3-MPK6 module plays an important role in the jasmonate signal transduction pathway through the negative regulation of MYC2/JIN1 expression. MKK9-MPK3/MPK6 module phosphorylates and activates EIN3, leading to the promotion of EIN3-mediated transcription in ethylene signaling. MPK3/MPK6 cascade regulates camalexin synthesis through transcriptional regulation of the biosynthetic genes after pathogen infection. MKK9-MPK6 module positively regulates leaf senescence. YDA-MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 module regulates stomatal cell fate before the guard mother cell (GMC) is specified. When activated, reinforces the feedback loop by phosphorylating BASL, and inhibits stomatal fate by phosphorylating SPCH (PubMed:25843888).

The double mutant wrky54 wrky70 exhibits stronger leaf senescence symptoms (PubMed:22268143). Almost no symptoms in response to E.amylovora (PubMed:22316300). Increased susceptibility to P.syringae associated with reduced PR1 induction in double mutants wrky46 wrky70 and wrky46 wrky53, and triple mutant wrky46 wrky70 wrky53. In these mutants, higher induction of PDF1.2 upon jasmonic acid (MeJA) treatment (PubMed:22325892).

Mediates the transport (export into the apoplast) of distinct indole-type metabolites in distinct biological processes; a precursor of 4-O-beta-D-glucosyl-indol-3-yl formamide (4OGlcI3F), a pathogen-inducible tryptophan-derived compound (e.g. upon Blumeria graminis conidiospore inoculation), being a probable substrate in extracellular pathogen defense (PubMed:26023163). Involved in the cellular detoxification of xenobiotics by promoting the excretion of some auxinic herbicides including 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid (2,4-DB) and other members of the phenoxyalkanoic acid family but not 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) (PubMed:20498067).

Mediates the transport (export into the apoplast) of distinct indole-type metabolites in distinct biological processes; a precursor of 4-O-beta-D-glucosyl-indol-3-yl formamide (4OGlcI3F), a pathogen-inducible tryptophan-derived compound (e.g. upon Blumeria graminis conidiospore inoculation), being a probable substrate in extracellular pathogen defense (PubMed:26023163). Involved in the cellular detoxification of xenobiotics by promoting the excretion of some auxinic herbicides including 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid (2,4-DB) and other members of the phenoxyalkanoic acid family but not 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) (PubMed:20498067).

P49030,disease_resistance,Oryza sativa subsp. japonica (Rice),"FUNCTION: Core component of the splicing-dependent multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC) deposited at splice junctions on mRNAs. The EJC is a dynamic structure consisting of core proteins and several peripheral nuclear and cytoplasmic associated factors that join the complex only transiently either during EJC assembly or during subsequent mRNA metabolism. The EJC marks the position of the exon-exon junction in the mature mRNA for the gene expression machinery and the core components remain bound to spliced mRNAs throughout all stages of mRNA metabolism thereby influencing downstream processes including nuclear mRNA export, subcellular mRNA localization, translation efficiency and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). The MAGO-Y14 heterodimer inhibits the ATPase activity of EIF4A3, thereby trapping the ATP-bound EJC core onto spliced mRNA in a stable conformation. The MAGO-Y14 heterodimer interacts with the EJC key regulator PYM leading to EJC disassembly in the cytoplasm (By similarity). EJC core heterodimers play essential roles in plant growth and development, and pollen and seed development (PubMed:25230811, PubMed:24820023).

Required for the production of JA in response to wounding (PubMed:14605232, PubMed:18786507). Necessary for flower and coleoptile development regulation by light, including blue (BL), red (RL) and far red (FR) lights (PubMed:23347338, PubMed:14605232, PubMed:15570396). Involved in the auxin-mediated signaling pathway leading to growth stimulation (PubMed:14605232, PubMed:19184094). Essential for photodestruction of phyA upon activation by RL and FR (PubMed:19184094).

Implicated in riboflavin-induced resistance to the sheath blight Rhizoctonia solani (PubMed:19729221). Required for Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS374r-mediated JA-dependent induced systemic resistance (ISR) against M.oryzae (PubMed:18945932). Confers some resistance, independently of the JA pathway but probably via OPDA accumulation, to brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens), a destructive, monophagous, piercing-sucking insect, mainly by reducing its feeding activity and survival rate (PubMed:25239066, PubMed:25627217). Triggers resistance to the chewing insect striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis, to the root hemiparasite witchweed Striga hermonthica, and to the root feeder insect rice water weevil Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus, in a JA-dependent manner, by attenuating both the growth mass and growth rate of caterpillars (PubMed:25239066, PubMed:25627217, PubMed:26025049). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18945932, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19729221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23347338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25239066, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25627217, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26025049}.","DISRUPTION PHENOTYPE: In cpm2 and hebiba mutants, impaired jasmonic acid biosynthesis. Flower morphological abnormalities and early flowering. Slight increased susceptibility to incompatible strains of the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea with higher hyphal growth and impaired phytoalexins (e.g. sakuranetin) production (PubMed:23347338). However, normal sensitivity to compatible strains of M.grisea (PubMed:23347338, PubMed:18786507). Impaired jasmonic acid accumulation in response to wounding (PubMed:18786507, PubMed:23347338, PubMed:14605232). In cpm2 and hebiba mutants, inversed response to light characterized by long-coleoptile phenotype under continuous white (WL), red (RL), far-red (FR) and blue (BL) lights due to impaired photoinhibition of coleoptile elongation, and short-coleoptile in darkness (PubMed:14605232, PubMed:23347338, PubMed:19184094). In the dark, long mesocotyl and short coleoptile associated with protochlorophyllides accumulation (PubMed:14605232, PubMed:15570396). In continuous far red (FRc) light: short mesocotyl and long coleoptile associated with a less pronounced reduction of phyA levels and no shift of the ratio between phyA' and phyA'' and abnormal induction of Pchlide(655) accumulation (PubMed:15570396). Delayed photodestruction of phyA upon activation by RL and FR lights (PubMed:19184094). In etiolated seedlings, higher levels of abscisic acid (ABA) but reduced levels of auxin indolyl-3-acetic acid (IAA) compensed by a strongly enhanced sensitivity to auxin on growth stimulation. Adult mutant plants exhibit excessive light green leaf growth, not erected but hanging downwards and even creeping along the soil. Impaired accumulation of basal O-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and apical JA in response to red light and wounding. Altered induction of OPR by red light (PubMed:14605232). Reduced male fertility leading to almost sterility with only a few fertile seeds in each panicle (PubMed:14605232, PubMed:23347338). Abnormal flower development characterized by sterile long lemmas, and sometimes elongated palea with additional bract-like organs between the lemma and palea as well as additional anthers and pistils (PubMed:23347338). Early flowering time (heading) (PubMed:14605232, PubMed:23347338). All these symptoms are rescued by exogenous methyl jasmonate (PubMed:14605232, PubMed:19184094). Impaired in Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS374r-mediated induced systemic resistance (ISR) against M.oryzae (PubMed:18945932). Reduced levels of PAL and lignin. Altered riboflavin-induced resistance to Rhizoctonia solani (PubMed:19729221).

Required for the JA-mediated signaling pathway that regulates many developmental and defense mechanisms, including growth root inhibition, vegetative storage proteins (VSPs) accumulation, induced systemic resistance (ISR), response to wounding and herbivores, tolerance to ozone O(3) (probably having a role in lesion containment). Plays an important role in the accumulation of JA-Ile in response to wounding, both locally and systemically; promotes JA responding genes especially in distal part of wounded plants, via the JA-Ile-stimulated degradation of JAZ repressor proteins by the SCF(COI)E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase pathway. Involved in the apoptosis-like programmed cell death (PCD) induced by fungal toxin fumonisin B1-mediated (FB1). Required for volatile compounds (C6-aldehydes and allo-ocimene)-mediated defense activation.

Q9C942,plant_height_reduce,Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress),"FUNCTION: Esterase involved in the biosynthesis of lignin. Hydrolyzes caffeoylshikimate into caffeate and shikimate. Together with 4-coumarate--CoA ligase (4CL), acts on an alternative reaction for the formation of caffeoyl-CoA and bypasses the second reaction of shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HST). Accepts also 4-coumaroylshikimate as substrate, but with lower activity. According to PubMed:20345607 and PubMed:22915575, posseses monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase, monoacylglycerol lipase and lysophospholipase activities in vitro. With the association of ACBP2, may promote the degradation of lysophosphatidylcholine and detoxify the peroxidized membrane in response to cadmium-induced oxidative stress. However these results require additional confirmation in vivo. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20345607, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20657176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22915575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23950498}.",DISRUPTION PHENOTYPE: Reduced height and weight of senescent plants due to reduced lignin content. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23950498}.,2013/11/13,

Binds ATP with high affinity through its extracellular legume-lectin like region (PubMed:24436418). Is required for ATP-induced intracellular calcium response, mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MPK3) and MPK6 activation and ATP-induced gene expression (PubMed:24436418, PubMed:25301072). May play a variety of roles in stress resistance (PubMed:24436418). May be involved in protein-protein interactions with RGD motif-containing proteins as potential ligands (PubMed:21483488, PubMed:16361528).
